Usage:

From the Terminal:

* Change to a suitable place in your $PATH

```cd /usr/local/bin/```

* Download unren.sh

```curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrunkel/unren/master/unren.sh```

* Make it executable

```chmod a+x unren.sh```

Profit!

Just kidding, type unren.sh and drag and drop the app icon when prompted.

Have fun!
